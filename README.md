# Yelpcamp
<p>My yelpcamp implementation following the tutorial by Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp</p>

<p>Uses NodeJS Express as backend with basic html/css/javascript frontend (and a little bit of bootstrap) with MongoDB as the database of choice.</p>

Basic implementation of a Yelp-like website but for campsites instead. Allows users to create their own campgrounds and share with friends. Also allows features such as comments as well.
